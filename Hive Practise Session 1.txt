Internal Table: Data Moves to Hive Warehouse
  - When we load data into an internal table, Hive moves the data from the HDFS location to the table's default location, which is inside the Hive warehouse             (/user/hive/warehouse/<table_name>).

 - The original data file is removed from its original location in HDFS after the load.

 - This means Hive takes full ownership of the data, and if the table is dropped, the data is also deleted.

External Table: Data Remains in Place
 - When loading data into an external table, Hive does not move the data; it stays in the original HDFS location specified during table creation.
 - The table only contains metadata pointing to that location.
 - Dropping an external table does not delete the actual data, only the metadata.

This behavior ensures that:

 - Internal tables are fully managed by Hive.
 - External tables allow data sharing across multiple tools without moving or duplicating files.
