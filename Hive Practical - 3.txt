1. Download vechile sales data -> https://github.com/shashank-mishra219/Hive-Class/blob/main/sales_order_data.csv

2. Store raw data into hdfs location
  to do this we can use copyfromlocal command 
hadoop fs -copyFromLocal data/sales_order_data.csv /tmp/hive_data;

3. Create a internal hive table "sales_order_csv" which will store csv data sales_order_csv .. make sure to skip header row while creating table

CREATE TABLE sales_data_assi (
    ORDERNUMBER INT,
    QUANTITYORDERED INT,
    PRICEEACH FLOAT,
    ORDERLINENUMBER INT,
    SALES FLOAT,
    STATUS STRING,
    QTR_ID INT,
    MONTH_ID INT,
    YEAR_ID INT,
    PRODUCTLINE STRING,
    MSRP INT,
    PRODUCTCODE STRING,
    PHONE STRING,
    CITY STRING,
    STATE STRING,
    POSTALCODE STRING,
    COUNTRY STRING,
    TERRITORY STRING,
    CONTACTLASTNAME STRING,
    CONTACTFIRSTNAME STRING,
    DEALSIZE STRING
)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
TBLPROPERTIES("skip.header.line.count"="1");

4. Load data from hdfs path into "sales_data_assi" 

load data inpath '/tmp/hive_data/sales_order_data.csv' into table sales_data_assi;

5.Create an internal hive table which will store data in ORC format "sales_order_orc"

CREATE TABLE sales_order_orc (
    ORDERNUMBER INT,
    QUANTITYORDERED INT,
    PRICEEACH FLOAT,
    ORDERLINENUMBER INT,
    SALES FLOAT,
    STATUS STRING,
    QTR_ID INT,
    MONTH_ID INT,
    YEAR_ID INT,
    PRODUCTLINE STRING,
    MSRP INT,
    PRODUCTCODE STRING,
    PHONE STRING,
    CITY STRING,
    STATE STRING,
    POSTALCODE STRING,
    COUNTRY STRING,
    TERRITORY STRING,
    CONTACTLASTNAME STRING,
    CONTACTFIRSTNAME STRING,
    DEALSIZE STRING
)
STORED AS ORC;

6. Load data from "sales_order_csv" into "sales_order_orc"

INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE sales_order_orc SELECT * FROM sales_data_assi;

Perform below menioned queries on "sales_order_orc" table :

a. Calculatye total sales per year

select year_id,sum(sales) as yearly_sales from sales_order_orc group by year_id;

b. Find a product for which maximum orders were placed

select ordernumber,sum(quantityordered) as total_quantity
from sales_order_orc
group by ordernumber 
order by total_quantity desc limit 1;

c. Calculate the total sales for each quarter

select year_id,qtr_id,sum(sales) as quarterly_sales from sales_order_orc
group by year_id,qtr_id

d. In which quarter sales was minimum

WITH t1 AS (
    SELECT a.year_id, 
           a.qtr_id, 
           a.quarterly_sales, 
           DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY a.quarterly_sales ASC) AS d_rnk 
    FROM (
        SELECT year_id, qtr_id, SUM(sales) AS quarterly_sales 
        FROM sales_order_orc 
        GROUP BY year_id, qtr_id
    ) a
) 
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE d_rnk = 1;

e. In which country sales was maximum and in which country sales was minimum

select country,sum(sales) as country_sales from sales_order_orc
group by country 
order by country_sales desc
limit 1

select country,sum(sales) as country_sales from sales_order_orc
group by country 
order by country_sales asc
limit 1
